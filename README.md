Contributed to by Alex Hoar, Dylan Katz, Martin Berger, Paul Siicu, Divya Cherukupalli, Kostya Yatsuk.

## Building

Just use the `.sln` file for building the game itself. It should be built with Visual Studio 2010, and it requires XNA.

For the score server, run `python score_server.py` and it will set up on port 5005.
