GameControl ================================================================================================
Currently working on:
	Displaying information on the screen
		(during GameOver) Highscore

So the competition is what, two weeks away? All we have done is a map where the guy can run from one room to the next, can't shoot arrows, doesn't get info on wumpus, no actual textures, no actual intro or end-game screen. If I've missed anything, i'm sorry, but as it is we already seem pretty screwed for this.
 
The actual to-do list:
Main-menu
      Create a REAL main menu screen, what I created in 30 seconds is NOT going to be in the competition Martin
 
In-Game
      Display for hints, so tell the player if they're next to the wumpus or not, same goes for all the obstacles Paul
      Shoot arrows into a different room (I have no idea how we're gonna do this with a six-sided room unless we convert the game to a top-down using the mouse to rotate and shoot Alex
      Get Trivia questions and display them in a separate screen Divya and Me
      Improve the textures and make it pretty (this'll take a lot of work (I think)) Martin
 
End-game
      Display highscore Me
      Save the current game to the highscore file (Dillon, explain how this works to me on Monday) Me

The text in blue is the suggested assigned roles are, they are up to debate.
 
P.S. EVERYBODY Lets get a functioning game done by this Friday, because most of us no longer have AP tests, and the teachers aren't going to be giving as much homework, so we'll have tons of time to code.
